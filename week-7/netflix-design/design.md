## Guidelines

### Schema Design:

- Define primary keys for each table.
- Use foreign keys to enforce relationships.
- Choose appropriate data types for each attribute.

### Normalization:

- Ensure your design is normalized to reduce redundancy but is also efficient for common queries (e.g., retrieving a user's watch history).

### Documentation:

- Provide a brief explanation (1-2 pages) describing your design decisions and how your schema meets the platform's needs.

### Optional Enhancements:

- Consider additional attributes if needed (e.g., timestamps, status flags) but keep the focus on the required entities.
